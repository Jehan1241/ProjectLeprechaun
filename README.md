# Quicksave
An upcoming game library manager. Inspired by and seeking to improve upon [Playnite](https://playnite.link/).

## Important
This is an early WIP project. While third party integration is complete, due to the non-standard and documented nature of external APIs certain games might cause unexpected behaviour.

## Build Instructions
* Frontend
```
git clone https://github.com/Jehan1241/QuickSave
cd QuickSave/Electron/electron-leprechaun
npm i
npm run dev
```
* Backend
```
cd backend
go make tidy
go run .
```
