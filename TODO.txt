SORT IN PROGRESS, Do everything on fetchData, not on another endpoint, causes DB locked errors

NOTE - It now can do steam library updates relatively quick However I currently check titleInDB vs titleOfOwned steam games and sometimes it's not an exact match which leads to extra
steam app details API calls, to fix consider adding steam APPID field? but then IGDB games don't have a steamID? [Morrowind vs Morrowind GOTY example]


- sort by ASC or DESC in a Better Way?
- FIX the sort double toggle dropdown
- More Themes, better Themes
- Fix IGDB Import page Sizing issue
- Somehow find a way to make sure steam import never fails on their end?
- Add Play button functionality to gameView
- When Sorting by Time display Time, by rating show rating
- PSN Integration --- (https://www.npmjs.com/package/psn-api)
- Xbox integration
- Playnite style custom Cover, SS and BG with a browser opened
- Find a way to make platfroms dropdown dark?
- Understan SSE properly
- Select random game button

- GameView - if small sized and scroll appears, scrolling on images does next img and scrolls down, disable scroll down

- Steam update, on game added, it reverts to alphabetical sorting & - SAVE sort State for next startup {doing this might auto fix prev}

game details - flatten return object
DisplayAllData() => only coverArt and titles and ID
Break into parts

FOR scrolling on main I've got scroll position to GameView

default sort is by Name, change later
3 sorts for now name time rating, add more???
