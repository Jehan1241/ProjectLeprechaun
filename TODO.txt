Look into concurrent SQLite writing (PSN and Steam Games together)

TODO - ability to change playtime for manually added games

Play Button :-
    - TODO: manually added games launch
        - The above is partially complete, .exe location is sent to DB, logic to run exe is left
        - If exe moves, system breaks
        - currently no way to remap the exe
        - RN user has to copy exe path manually, make it a path thing
    - TODO: Windows games launch
    - uninstalled games throw an invalid platform errors
    - Potentially support other linux versions of steam later

PSN Integration :-
    - Works for newerGames and olderGames
    - TODO : Incase 200+ games, use offset
    - TODO : Get Games from TrophiesAPI for ps3 titles
    - WHAT DO I DO IF GAME IS ALR ADDED FROM STEAM?????????????????

- Playtime update does'nt update order untill reordered
- sort by ASC or DESC in a Better Way?
- FIX the sort double toggle dropdown
- More Themes, better Themes
- Fix IGDB Import page Sizing issue
- Somehow find a way to make sure steam import never fails on their end?
- When Sorting by Time display Time, by rating show rating
- Xbox integration
- Playnite style custom Cover, SS and BG with a browser opened
- Find a way to make platfroms dropdown dark?
- Select random game button

TODO: game details - flatten return object
DisplayAllData() => only coverArt and titles and ID
Break into parts

UI TODOS :-
    - More information in GameView (rating)
    - Gameview: cursor on image row  and scroll should advance the horizontal scroll position
    - Extra vertical scroll bar spawns when hovering on lowest games in library view

FOR scrolling on main I've got scroll position to GameView
