1. Redo Import pages - almost done, just fix the sizing somehow
2. Somehow find a way to make sure steam import never fails on their end?
5. Add Play button functionality to gameView

game details - flatten return object
DisplayAllData() => only converart and titles and ID
Break into parts

FOR scrolling on main I've got scroll position to GameView
